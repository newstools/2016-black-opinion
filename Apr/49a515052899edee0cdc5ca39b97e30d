Dear Editor, I hear your analysis of the situation at hand, and Iâ€™m fully cognisant and to a great extent agree with your opinion. However, your analysis seems to leave out the fact that Zuma himself has given me what capital through his conduct. The Guptas in my view have gone overboard by for example landing at Waterkloof. Even though your analysis is true, however, I do feel that it tries to shift the blame away from the president himself. Regards, Mageba No related posts.
