BO Staff Writer Black Opinion is saddened to hear of the sudden death of Black music legend Prince. The iconic entertainer passed away on Thursday at the age of 57.  Like most black innovators, Prince broke boundaries, creating and contributing to the creation of a distinct black sound, infused with Rock ‘n Roll, RnB, Soul, Jazz and Hip Hop. Music that has brought life to black people in times of sorrow, joy, fear, death and celebration. Prince was also one of the first people to defy narrow and binary gender norms as early as the 1980’s. He has released more than 35 studio albums and has sold millions of records. The video below is of Prince performing at a James Brown and Friends concert in 1983.  BO says Rest In Power Prince!     No related posts.
