Omnibus Black Letters for the week   Yesterday important pieces were published, namely:   1. Five Perspectives On Why Pravin Gordhan’s Budget Is Anti-Black, by BO Staff Writer 2. How The Medical Care Industry Is Screwing Us – Time To Rethink Healthcare, by Ayanda Tshazi 3. Why The #BuyBlack Campaign Is A Step Towards Black Liberation, by Andiswa Flatela 4. Buy Black? Beware Of White Supremacy – The Case Of “Black Wall Street”,  by BO Staff Writer   Some of the above pieces were published last night and many are yet to go through them.  Let’s read, learn and grow!   White media has a clear agenda of maintaining white supremacy. It is doing what it has set out to do in line with its anti black agenda. Black Opinion is committed to black liberation and therefore prioritizes the black truth. This is in tune with our revolutionary agenda.   Have a great weekend!   We write what we like coz we black qha! No related posts.
