There is currently a big debate in SA following weeks long campaigns by the major banks to warn the public about the “pyramid scheme” called MMM, which was created by an anti establishment Russian mathematician Sergey Panteleevich Mavrodi. More specifically MMM is described on its website as follows:  “MMM is a Global Mutual Aid Fund, World people’s Bank, Financial Social Network — or any definition whatsoever. The point is not in the title. The bottom line is that this is a voluntary informal association of millions and millions of people throughout the Earth, rebelled against the financial slavery, chose to declare war against the … banks. (And to win this war!!) And for this aim they have consolidated their capital — even though there are small amounts, owing to a great number, that is millions of people, it’s already the power. Awesome and invincible power, growing every day!”  The banks are accusing MMM for doing what they have been doing all along. The only one striking difference is that with the bank scam only a tiny elite benefits and the slavery of the rest of society is perpetuated. MMM seems to turn on the logic of rotating money and opening to the masses the doors of the vaults of the illusion called money . The banks, governments, media and politicians are not happy.  Black Opinion invites critical contributions and testimonies on all aspects of MMM.  Here we publish an article that first appeared in “Modern Survival Blog” on February 12, 2015  titled “The Bank Pyramid Scheme” which gives an interesting explanation of how banks and money operates. We also provide a link to the ideology of MMM.  Please submit your contributions and testimonials regarding MMM by email to editor@blackopinion.co.za  by  5 May 2016.
