By BO Staff Writer The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) was instructed by its London handlers, just like Dr. Mamphele Ramphele, to join hands with the racist right wing party, the Democratic Alliance (DA). Soon after the secret meeting with the agent of the British queen, Lord Robin Renwick, EFF announced that it would be uniting with other opposition parties. This was a coded way to say an alliance with the DA shall be formed to advance the anti-BRICS agenda and to defend monopoly white capital. The Sunday Times has revealed that the EFF has held multiple secret meetings with the DA after the London trip. Sources say that the London agenda shall be realised should the ruling party get less than 50% in most municipalities and metros. According to these sources, the EFF shall promptly enter into coalitions with the DA to co-govern. This claim has been confirmed by the national chairperson of the EFF, Advocate Dali Mpofu, who told weekend newspapers that, “EFF shall go into coalition with anyone but the ANC.” The implications of this London agenda is that those who are voting for the EFF are essentially voting for the racist and pro-white monopoly of the DA. Voters are being duped with faux radical rhetoric in order to maintain white power.
