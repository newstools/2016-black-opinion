By BO Staff Writer Read below a message issued by the Black First Land First National Coordinating Committee (BLF NCC) regarding the court appearance of the #BLF26 happening tomorrow. The 26 Black First Land First (BLF) members facing multiple charges for staging a sit-in at the Public Protectorâ€™s office shall appear at Court 62 at the Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Facility in Tshwane tomorrow morning at 9:00 am. BLF has subsequently met with the deputy Public Protector, Advocate Kevin Sifiso Malunga, via an invite to the headquarters of the Public Protector in Tshwane on August 8, 2016 where they had been arrested over 3 weeks ago. The meeting was cordial and fairly productive.  BLF was shocked to learn that the investigation of white corruption has been reduced to focusing only on R3.2 billion stolen and given in part to ABSA. BLF sees this as an attempt to shield white capital, including Johann Rupert, who has directly benefited from stealing the R26 billion from the South African Reserve Bank. BLF shall not stop until the entire R26 billion is recovered and given to the Black youth. BLF is confident that all the trumped up charges shall eventually be dismissed in court. Once that has occurred we shall sue the Public Protector for both defamation and wrongful prosecution.  We shall not be intimidated nor silenced.
