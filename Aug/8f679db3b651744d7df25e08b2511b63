By Andile Mngxitama The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is put in a unique position to either use itâ€™s share of the vote to demand land expropriation without compensation, free education and other progressive policies, or it can choose to consolidate white racism.  The African National Congress (ANC) is in a seriously vulnerable position as a result of the possibility of dropping to below 51% in some of the key metropolitan cities. This presents the EFF with the opportunity to press for real change. The ANC can be forced to change national policy on land and other key areas in exchange for the votes to keep some metros. A deal could be structured with clear objectives and time frames. Unlike the initial offer of the 6% national vote to amend section 25 of the constitution (the property clause), which the ANC rejected because it could afford to at the time, the ruling party now needs the votes and it would be more difficult to say no. Forcing the hand of the ANC to take on the land thieves and white capital is the most progressive option to use the mandate given to the EFF by voters. But the EFF has chosen to rather consolidate white power by deciding to go into a possible coalition with the racist pro-white capital Democratic Alliance (DA). Only DA benefits from a coalition with EFF and it serves white power. An EFF and DA coalition is in line with the London agenda which is about maintaining white power.  The lack of interest by EFF to use its votes to demand radical change shows how far to the ideological right it has turned as it worries about how its viewed by white capital here and abroad.  This is another lost opportunity for using the ballot to push for radical change.
