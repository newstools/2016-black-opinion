By BO Staff Writer SABC group executive for corporate affairs, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, along with acting CEO James Aguma, the only board member left, board chairperson Mbulaheni Maguvhe and the rest of the SABC delegation, all staged a walked out of parliament’s ad hoc committee proceedings today.  The ad hoc committee was set up to investigate the “fitness of the SABC board to hold office.” In a press briefing after the walkout, Motsoeneng highlighted some of the reasons for the walkout and addressed some of the untruths circulating in the white owned media about the SABC – government funding particularly. Motsoeneng has been fighting serious battles in the public broadcaster. White monopoly capital, along with its lackeys in the white media, want to wrap their tentacles around the state owned entity. They want to oust him because of his exemplary transformation programs (e.g. 90% local content and ending labour brokering).
