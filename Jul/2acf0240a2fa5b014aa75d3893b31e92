By BO Staff Writer Twenty-six members of the Black First Land First movement have been arrested and are being held at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria, after they occupied the office of the public protector, Thuli Madonsela this afternoon. The group were protesting Thuli Madonsela’s refusal to act on, and investigate cases of corruption against white capitalists like Johann Rupert. Some of the demands by the protesters included “the investigation of the R26 billion that was stolen by white capitalists from the public,” and they want the public protector to address the “complaint of state capture by white capitalists, including that of Johann Rupert, lodged with her office in March this year.” Among those arrested is the BLF’s National Convenor Andile Mngxitama, the National Coordinator Yerushka Chetty, Spokesperson Lindsay Maasdorp, Secretary for Political Education Ncedisa Mpemnyama among others. Sources say that the group will be charged with public violence and trespassing. Late last year BLF released a damning report titled “Preliminary Report on Apartheid Era Corruption and other Economic Crimes” which reveals that more than R500 billion has been stolen by white capital from the country since apartheid. To date, the Public Protector has done nothing about this corruption. To read the full report click here. As the protesters were peacefully occupying the office of the public protector armed police officers barged in and harassed and arrested them. Watch below videos of BLF members peacefully engaging in dialogue with employees of the public protector when a police officer suddenly pushes a door open and violently wields a gun at the members. The following videos were captured by Yerushka Chetty, who is among those arrested.  Below is a full list of all those who have been arrested corageously seeking justice:
