By Zanele Lwana and Lindsay Maasdorp Black First Land First (BLF) has today (18/07/2016) decided to visit the office of the Public Protector to demand answers for two important matters:  1. What is the update on the investigation of the R26 billion that was stolen by white capitalists from the public? The complaint is now 5 years old. This is 105 Nkandlas. 2. When will the Public Protector update BLF and address the complaint of state capture by white capitalists, including that of Johann Rupert, lodged with her office in March this year? The office of the Public Protector has consistently lied and ignored the complaints and inquiries BLF has placed before her. We have decided to go to her office today, and shall not move until we have been answered. We note the courtesy and urgency the office of the Public Protector gives to complaints made by whites and the Democratic Alliance (DA) against blacks, but she is totally uninterested in investigating white corruption. Adv. Madonsela has reduced her office into being used as an arm of the DA. WE WANT THE R26 BILLON NOW!
WE WANT REPORTS ON STATE CAPTURE BY WHITE CAPITALISTS NOW! Zanele Lwana and Lindsay Maasdorp are both Spokespersons of the Black First Land First movement.
