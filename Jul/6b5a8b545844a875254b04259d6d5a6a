The OTT is a community based organization which is led by the 1976 Soweto uprising veteran Seth Mazibuko. The electoral pact between BLF and OTT follows the BLF’s National Coordination Committee’s resolution to support candidates who endorse the SANKARA OATH. BLF was unfairly excluded from contesting the 2016 LGE by the IEC. The signing of the Sankara Oath shall happen today at 12:00 at the Orlando East Rugby Stadium NO 1 in Soweto. Once the OTT signs the Sankara Oath, BLF shall provide support for its candidates including campaigning for the OTT. For further details contact: Zwelakhe Dubasi (BLF Soweto coordinator)
