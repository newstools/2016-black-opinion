Image: Pastor Xola Skosana and Andile Mngxitama have been banned multiple times this year by Facebook. By BO Staff Writer Facebook is two faced. In the same week it endorsed Black Lives Matter it banned two Black Consciousness and Pan Afrikanist outspoken activists in South Africa for thirty days.  Pastor Xola Skosana of The Way of Life Kilombo in Khayelitsha, Cape Town is a known revolutionary activist for black liberation. His postings are unapologetic and pro black. Andile Mngxitama is the National Convenor of the Black Consciousness movement Black First Land First (BLF) which has declared Micah Xavier Johnson a martyr of black liberation. The banning of Skosana and Mngxitama follows their postings which favored the right to self defense for black people. The ban by Facebook shows that the white establishment tolerates blacks who do not threaten the white status quo. Black people the world over are being coerced into denouncing revolutionary violence whilst being killed everyday, everywhere on earth. In this context most black organisations globally are made to be silent on the Micah Manifesto which directs black people to fight back. The white media and institutions love black people who march and sing “we shall overcome” but blacks with guns in their hands ready to defend themselves are denounced as criminal. Also, black organizations are encouraged to take a peaceful stance against a system which is not peaceful to blacks. Facebook is a white supremacist platform which systematically silences black voices of rebellion. Black Opinion shall as far as is possible publish Skosana and Mngxitama’s updates. If they close one door we must create another. Remember the teachings of Assata Shakur, “A wall is just a wall. It can be broken down.” Black people must develop their own platforms. The biggest war today, as always, is the propaganda war. Those who control information have already won the battle.
