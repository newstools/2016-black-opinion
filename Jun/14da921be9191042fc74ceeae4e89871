By BO Editorial CollectiveCHAPTER 22 of the BLACK AGENDA on nationalisation and socialization of the mineral and natural resources calls for democratizing the economy through nationalization of 100% of the commanding heights. This will translate into direct ownership by the people. In this context the state will only regulate the people&#8217;s collective ownership. Let&#8217;s read and engage. Send your questions, comments, feedback, etcetera to the following email address: editor@blackopinion.co.zaBLACK AGENDA stands for nationalising and liquidating 100% of all commanding heights of the economy. All mineral wealth (gold, diamonds, platinum, etc.) and also all forests, waters and skies of state importance, shall pass into the exclusive use of the state in the interests of the whole people. All the small streams, rivers, lakes, dams, woods, etc. shall pass into the use of the communes (as the people will be organized into) to be administered by the local self-governing land committees.Ownership, control and management of all mineral wealth shall translate into direct ownership by the people and state protection of people&#8217;s rights.What Is To Be Done?BROAD BASED MEANINGFUL ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT1. In line with achieving the main goals of the BLF of ensuring the radical transformation of the economy, eradicating poverty, creating jobs and other means of livelihood, maintaining macroeconomic stability and developing, enhancing and sustaining the economy&#8217;s capacity to produce goods and services, BLACK AGENDA shall devise and recommend ideological guidelines and policy to inform the achievement of these goals.2. To this end the BLACK AGENDA shall focus on Broad Based Meaningful Economic Empowerment to ensure that the majority of South Africans are integrated, through the State, into the mainstream economy and that the people become drivers and beneficiaries of the economic activities in the country.3. Devise ideological guidelines and policy to elaborate on inter alia the following as means to achieve Broad Based Meaningful Economic Empowerment:a. Community Share Ownership Schemes so as to:i) counter the culture of the patronizing Corporate Social Responsibility concessionary programs that has traditionally characterised big mining businesses;ii) secure for the community a proportion (at least 20%) of the equity in the mining businesses;iii) secure for the community meaningful proportional representation in the official control and management structure of the scheme;iv) enable communities to benefit from the natural resources of the country, and;v) reinforce the role of communities in economic development by enabling them to make the right decisions in terms their empowerment priorities.b. Worker and State Share Ownership schemes so as to:i) ensure that workers participate through the medium of having direct equity stake in the mining enterprise they are working in;ii) secure for the workers a significant proportion (at least 20%) of the equity in the mining enterprises;iii. secure for the workers meaningful proportional representation in the official control and management structures of schemes;iv) secure for the workers sufficient all round job satisfaction and stable employment, and;v) reinforce the role of workers in the development and increase of industrialization for import substitution by enabling them to make the right decisions in terms their empowerment priorities.c. Direct Equity Participation schemes so as to:i) ensure black majority shareholding in all strategic economic actions;ii) ensure all mergers, restructurings, unbundling of business, de-mergers, relinquishment of a controlling interest shall comply with the black majority shareholding requirement, and;iii) ensure that any direct equity achieved from c (i) and (ii) as well as from the Employee Share Ownership Schemes and Community Share ownership schemes shall serve the sole purpose of ensuring that participation and ownership in the economic activities of the country maintain and perpetuate the total nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy so as to facilitate the rectification of past injustices including poverty eradication and economic growth along black socialist lines.d) Procurement of Goods so as to:i) facilitate import substitution through supporting the procurement of goods from indigenous South Africans.ii) ensure that at least 50% of the goods procured by all enterprises should be procured from the indigenous population;iii) put legislation in place to ensure that commercial contracts are concluded with indigenous entrepreneurs so as to guarantee the development of indigenous businesses, the enhancement of livelihoods and the ultimate growth of the economy of South Africa.e. National Sovereign Wealth Development Fund so as to:i) reduce the wide gap between the rich and the poor and ensure economic growth;ii) filter the income from the nations natural resources towards the rectification of past injustices including poverty eradication and economic growth;iii) address the finite status of mineral resources by developing secondary industries as alternative bases of development after the mineral resources have been depleted, and;iv) finance development programs across the country so as to stimulate the growth of the country&#8217;s economy.f. Strategic Sector Specific Frameworks so as to:i) ensure that the indigenous black majority participates in the various strategic sectors such as Mining, Education, Agriculture, Manufacturing, Communication, Finance, Tourism etc so as to facilitate the rectification of past injustices including poverty eradication and economic growth.STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE1. Black Agenda shall devise and recommend ideological guidelines to elaborate on:i) the mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the system of state monopoly capitalism that Direct Equity Participation schemes will tend to feed into and perpetuate, is made to serve the interests of the whole people so as to cease to be state capitalism;ii) the need for the reorganization and higher development of industry and to that end its adjustment to the needs of the black majority as a crucial aspect of the realization of economic freedom along socialist lines to replace racial capitalism;iii) the mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the above Direct Equity Participation schemes do not serve to create and promote ( as a reactionary strategic objective) an indigenous anti-black bourgeoisie coexisting with or replacing the current one, and;iv) the mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the above Direct Equity Participation schemes serve to destroy the current anti-black neo colonial economic order and replace it with one that is responsive to people&#8217;s needs.v) the mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the above Direct Equity Participation schemes serve to destroy the current anti-black neo colonial economic order and replace it with one that is responsive to people&#8217;s needs.
