By BO Editorial CollectiveCHAPTER 11 of the BLACK AGENDA on corruption indicates a veil of deception over apartheid era crimes involving corruption and a recognition that corruption, which was symptomatic of the colonial structural logic, continues to characterize and shape our current reality. To this end the current trend of corruption cannot be eliminated unless the structural logic that dictates such corruption is destroyed and the beneficiaries of apartheid, especially white capital, are exposed and held accountable.

These companies, under the special dispensation protected by law, disclosed their illegal activities to the tune of R68,6 billion in foreign assets. The ANC government only asked them to pay back R2,9 billion. Similarly, the construction cartel which collectively and illegally amassed R50 billion from the world cup deals, was only fined a paltry R2.7 billion.&nbsp;A report submitted to former President Thabo Mbeki, by a private investigator in the United Kingdom, revealed that he could trace R26 billion stolen by apartheid leaders and placed offshore. This grand theft has received scant attention from the office of the Public Protector.&nbsp;R563 Billion was stolen by white capital of which R141. 6 Billion is recoverable immediately. These billions were stolen by apartheid leaders acting in collaboration with certain sectors of white business. Briefly the total amount of R563 billion is made of the following: R68,6 billion constituting illegal offshore deposits by white businesses; R50 Billion stolen by the construction cartel; R26 Billion stolen from SARB; R422 Billion stolen in 2007 via capital flight&nbsp;In the process of its investigations BLF has gained insight inter alia into the practices relating to the procurement processes and public service accountability during the apartheid era. Black Agenda recognizes that the activities and dealings of the perpetrators of apartheid era crimes relates inter alia to corruption; abuses of the SA currency; money laundering; illegal dealings in minerals, precious metals and natural resources; shady foreign exchange transactions; illegal &#8220;life boa loans&#8221;, and; illegal shifting of assets including monies into offshore tax haven or shelters.&nbsp;A collusionary web of silence appears to have been cast over apartheid era economic crimes. Black Agenda recognizes that corruption, which was structurally inherent in our colonial past, still shapes the DNA of our contemporary political, economic, legal and cultural reality. Corruption has become part of the daily ritual of white and black elites in South Africa. The current tide of corruption cannot be rooted out unless the historical patterns of interrelatedness of private and public sector corruption is exposed, and apartheid beneficiaries, in particular, white capital, are held accountable.&nbsp;Given the silence against historical crimes of corruption against blacks, the current outcry on corruption is indeed farcical.&nbsp;The Involvement Of Johann Rupert And Eight Others In The Firing Of Des Van Rooyen And Hiring Of Pravin Gordhan As Minister Of Finance:&nbsp;The current crisis regarding the state relates to the involvement of Johan Rupert and 8 other white capitalists in the firing of Des Van Rooyen and the hiring of Pravin Gordhan as the Minister of Finance in 2015. To this end BLF has laid criminal charges against the following persons for contravening Section 4 of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, 2004 (Act No. 12 of 2004):&nbsp;SA Businessman and Chairman of Swiss luxury group Richemont, Johann Rupert;Barclays Africa Group Chief Executive Officer, Maria Ramos;Goldman Sachs&#8217; South Africa head, Colin Coleman;Investec Bank&#8217;s global CEO, Stephen Koseff;Imperial Holdings&#8217; CEO, Mark Lamberti;Business Leadership South Africa chairperson, Bobby Godsell;Toyota Europe CEO, Johan van ZylFirst Rand, CEO Johan Burger&nbsp;In this regard BLF alleges the following two incidents of corruption:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Is To Be Done?&nbsp;BLACK AGENDA recognizes the following actions as indicated in the BLF&#8217;s preliminary report on apartheid era corruption and other economic crimes:&nbsp;&#8211; Public Protector to provide updates on investigations into the theft of billions of rands by apartheid leaders and beneficiaries.&nbsp;&#8211; President Zuma to release the CIEX report&nbsp;&#8211; Treasury to disclose how much was declared by amnesty applicants &amp; what was actually paid to the State&nbsp;&#8211; Treasury to reveal what action was taken in relation to companies which did not comply with the amnesty provisions&nbsp;&#8211; Demand an end to impunity of multinational companies for corporate crimes&nbsp;&#8211; Demand an end to capital flight, and; the payment of reparations for all capital flight that occurred during the apartheid era and beyond&nbsp;&#8211; All the monies recovered from all these thefts to be set aside for youth empowerment and direct benefit (18-35 years)&nbsp;&#8211; The abolition of the ruinous colonial loan contracts including IMF and World Bank contracts, and the damages arising from this to be factored into claims for reparation.&nbsp;BLF will, in the course of its campaign against apartheid era corruption and other economic crimes, elaborate on the above actions in line with the following objectives of the report: inform the nation of the extent of corruption and the role of white capital in it; identify where the money is and who stole it (focusing on apartheid leaders &#8211; political and business); recover the stolen wealth of the nation; undertake both civil and criminal action against the guilty; insist that the SA government take action against white capital and stop protecting it; show the link of corruption that binds state and white capital; institute a principled struggle against corruption, and; encourage basic economic literacy amongst the people so as to demystify corruption and identify the main culprit.&nbsp;In line with BLF&#8217;s undertaking, BLACK AGENDA shall facilitate direct action including legal action to fight corruption at its root. To this end it will engage like-minded organizations in pursuance of principled struggle against corruption.&nbsp;All those who were involved in apartheid era corruption and other economic crimes as well as the powerful capitalist plotters and state capture agents not limited to those mentioned above must face the full extent of the law. White capital has historically been allowed to break the law with impunity. This situation must be corrected. BLF has vowed to see the matter to its finality and shall consider private prosecutions should the state decline to prosecute.&nbsp;By BO Editorial Collective&nbsp;&nbsp;
