Photo: Supplied By BO Staff Writer The Black First Land First (BLF) movement will be hosting their Black Agenda Launch conference on May 14 and among the activities of the day will be art performance, including a performance by Cape Town based rap duo Jargon Music. No stranger to radical black politics, Jargon Music members Lukhanyo Zondani and Ncedisa Mpemnyama were hands on (and still continue to be) in the many student protests that revitalised radical politics in South Africa last year. This, along with many other politically and ideologically charged actions (including starting a youth based collective called Outkast Society), have put Jargon Music at the forefront of ‘socially conscious’ rap music, and art in general, in South Africa. Ncedisa is also the BLF National Secretary for Political Education. With lyrics oozing black consciousness and a devotion to pan-Afrikanism, Jargon Music echoes poet and Black Arts Movement adherent, Amiri Baraka’s assertion about art and politics, “The attempt to divide art and politics is Bourgeois philosophy which says good poetry, art, cannot be political, but since everything is, by the nature of society, political, even an artist or work that claims not to have any politics is making a political statement by that act.” Out of the aesthetic of the Xhosa Cape Town hip hop scene called “Spaza”, Jargon have crafted a unique, energetic sound incorporating jazz, reggea and soulful vocals into their sound. Listen to Jargon Music featuring Soska in the song, Music, here. In the video below, Jargon Music performs a song titled Tata Wam, a song dedicated to absent black fathers and the void they leave in their families and society because of their absence – of course taking into cognisance what creates a situation and society where black fathers find it easier to escape rather than be there for their families.
