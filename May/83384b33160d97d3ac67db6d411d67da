Black First Land First (BLF) is delighted to announce that a delegation from the United States based, pro-black, anti-racist, anti-capitalist, anti-patriarchy movement â€“ Black Lives Matter shall be attending the BLF founding conference in Soweto this coming Saturday. Black Lives Matter has been instrumental in fighting against American institutionalised racism that sees black people as less than nothing; being murdered by the police every day. Black people are over represented in prisons and on death row because of racism. The parallels between South Africa and the USA runs deep. As a movement guided by the teachings of Black Consciousness and Pan-Afrikanism, BLF welcomes this opportunity for international black solidarity!
