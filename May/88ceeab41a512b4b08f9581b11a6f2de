By Staff Writer  There were many doubts propagated by the detractors of the newly formed black first land first movement, who said it won’t be able to fill a class room. The turn out at the launch on a cold rainy day dispelled the notion that BLF is a “stockvel” without support. The Uncle Tom’s hall in Soweto was full to capacity. Bev Ditsie in her speech to conference highlighted how blacks are not free and how political leaders continue to beg for the liberation of people from whites. She referred to the delegations to London by successive black leaders to beg the queen of England. She also emphasised the need for revolutionary black movements to overcome patriarchy and homophobia. Her speech was well received by the conference. Pastor Xola Skosana in his speech called for buy black campaign and also called for the Azanian front to be established. He asked BLF to lead the process of uniting all the Black Consciousness and Pan Africanist organisations in South Africa. The conference adopted the resolution for establishing the Azanian front with such organisations as the Azanian People’s Organisation (AZAPO), Socialist Party of Azania (Sopa), Black Consciousness Party and the Pan Africanist Congress (pac). In his closing remarks to the conference the national convenor of BLF Andile Mngxitama said, “it’s indictment that all the opposition parties shares the same ideology of the freedom charter which has proven to be anti black and sold the land rights of blacks” he further said, “Pan Africanist and Black Consciousness one side and charterist one side”. He concluded by saying “let the children of Sobukwe and Biko Unite”.
