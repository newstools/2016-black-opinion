By BO Editorial Collective As part of our commitment to the campaign initiated by Pastor Xola Skosana of buying black, Black Opinion (BO) has offered free advertising space to black businesses. Most black businesses have a challenge to develop adverts that can readily be uploaded on our site. This call is for black graphic designers who wish to assist in building black businesses by giving their skills by creating suitable adverts for them. We urge black graphic designers who wish to make the #BuyBlack campaign a success to come forward. Send your details to editor@blackopinion.co.za
