By Jeff Koorbanally Dear Adv Mkhwebane I make reference to the letter addressed to you on the 14th, whereby I raised the concern about the sensitization of these reports. I contest, with strongest resentment, that the former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, should call or label our country a “State of Capture”, that’s the biggest insult to our democracy, which we as the people that fought for this democracy will not entertain! The State of Capture is “Stellenbosch” where she is currently placed in conform, of attempted regime change campaign, of which she has been and still party to. Why did she choose to omit the complaint of Black First Land First (BLF) which form part of this so-called State of Capture, in terms of Rupert having an influence or dictating to our President to fire Minister Des Van Rooyen & replace him with Gordhan? What is the difference between that & what has been alleged against the Guptas in terms of the alleged prior knowledge of the firing of Minister Nene and replacement with Minister Van Rooyen. I put it to you that it equates to the same. The Ruperts also had prior knowledge or played part in the firing of one Cabinet Minister (Van Rooyen) & appointment of the other (Gordhan). Therefore unless the complaint of BLF is incorporated into this report, I declare this report a “White Wash” and the most bias piece of document produced by the OPP. Sincerely
J.Koorbanally
