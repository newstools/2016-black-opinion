Media Statement Black First Land First (BLF) shall tomorrow morning open a criminal case against Johann Rupert and 16 others implicated in the theft of R26 billion from the South African Reserve Bank (SARS). This is the money of the people and it must be returned. BLF shall submit a statement of evidence to the police to assist it in investigating corruption by white capitalists who stole from the people. BLF had asked the former Public Protector, Advocate Thuli Mandonsela, to speed up the investigation on this issue. However she has time and again after promising to finalise the matter by the end of 2015, left Office without doing so. BLF hopes that the new Public Protector shall carry the investigation forward. However since it is also a criminal matter, BLF will now open a criminal case with the police to recover the R26 billion and bring to book these criminals. The case will be opened under the following details:
