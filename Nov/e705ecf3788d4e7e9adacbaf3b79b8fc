By BO Staff Writer The Black First Land First (BLF) has written a letter to the head of the National Prosecution Authority (NPA), Shaun Abrahams, demanding that the charges against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, be withdrawn. In the letter, BLF provides evidence that shows that Malema has never in his life led a land occupation. Furthermore, BLF has given the NPA a long list of evidence that shows that Malema doesn’t support land occupations, he only speaks about land occupation during elections to get votes. Should the NPA not drop the charges against Mr Malema then BLF shall apply to join the matter as a friend of the court to provide evidence in defence of Mr Malema.
