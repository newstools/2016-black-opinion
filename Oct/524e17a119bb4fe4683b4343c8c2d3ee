By Zanele Lwana and Lindsay Maasdorp Black First Land First  (BLF) notes with concern the wrongful charges preferred against the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Julius Malema, by the NPA. Malema has never led a land occupation. He only speaks about it around election time to get the landless to vote for him. Surely, Malema has rights like all citizens and should be allowed his freedom of expression. Furthermore, as a politician he surely can’t be brought to court for merely making threats for mere political gain. The National Convener of BLF,  Andile Mngxitama, has offered to testify on behalf of Malema to prove his innocence. The NPA on this one is certainly chasing after the wrong man. For the record, BLF believes that land occupations are a legitimate strategy to regain our stolen land and shouldn’t be used as a cheap political ploy to deceive the landless. If any thing Malema may be guilty of, it is deceiving the poor and landless. It would seem that even the NPA is taken by Malema’s rhetorical dexterity. BLF shall write to the NPA to ask it to drop the charges against Malema. Should the matter go to court then Mngxitama shall ask to be allowed to testify on behalf of Malema. No innocent person must be punished for things s/he has not done.
