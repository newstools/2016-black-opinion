By BO Staff Writer The Johann Rupert media wonâ€™t tell you this news. The white owned media is engaged in a massive disinformation campaign to defend white capital and have long stopped reporting with balance. If you are reading the white owned Sowetan, City Press, Sunday Times or Daily Sun, to mention a few, you are busy using your money to brainwash yourself. White media, such as eNCA, must be viewed with heightened critical awareness. All media must of course be viewed critically if one has to avoid becoming an uninformed victim of their propaganda. These white owned media have muted the big news of last week when the Corporate Affairs manager at the SABC announced yet another radical transformation initiative at the SABC. The vocal COSATU was nowhere to be seen to express support for the initiative to end the exploitation by labour brokers at SABC. Last week, Hlaudi Motsoeneng announced how the SABC has met with the outsourced security personnel and advised them to form a co-operative which would then be directly contracted by the SABC. Motsoeneng furthermore indicated that after the security guards, the next in line to be insourced are the cleaners. The battle against labour brokers has been the most difficult over the years. It took a visionary and a patriotic manager to end the suffering of the exploited black workers at the SABC. But the media has a total black-out on these revolutionary initiatives led by Motsoeneng at the SABC. Many progressive black people are beginning to understand why there is a campaign against Motsoeneng. He is not captured by white capital and is not seduced by the white media. Motsoeneng is an exemplary black manager whose management style needs to be followed by all if we wish for transformation in our life time.
