By Tebogo Brown The media in the past few days has been abuzz with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s 80th birthday. I am not trying to be a party pooper but we need to remind those who don’t or may have forgotten that young men such as Stompie Seipei and Lolo Sono were murdered long before they were 80. I don’t even think their parents were 80 when their sons were tortured and murdered. Dr Abubaker Asvat of the Black Consciousness Movement wasn’t so lucky either to have lived until the age of 80 before succumbing before the known assassin’s bullets. His sin was to have come up with a prognosis that wasn’t favourable to the torturers of Stompie Seipei. Dr Asvat examined a badly beaten Stompie at Mrs Madikizela-Mandela’s house and told her that Stompie could die at anytime so he should be taken to hospital. The police bungled the case even when two self-confessed assassins of Dr Asvat, Thulani Nicholas Dlamini and Cyril Mbatha came forward. The Mail and Guardian of 05 September 1997 published under the headline, “Winnie hires me to kill Dr Asvat” has published all the details. One wonders how the families of the people mentioned in this submission feel when a person who is accused of having a hand in their deaths is referred to as “mother of the nation or mother of Africa”. Mrs Albertina Sisulu worked at Dr Asvat’ practice at the time of the assassination. If she wanted to spill the beans she could have done so. But she went to the grave without having blown the whistle. Katiza Cebekhulu who is a witness to all the murders and he was forced to flee the country and now stays somewhere abroad and can’t come home. Cases of murder can still be pursued against Madikizela-Mandela since there is no statute of limitation in murder cases.
