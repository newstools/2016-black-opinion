MEDIA STATEMENT Black First Land First (BLF) shall today join the #FeesMustFall march to parliament to demand that Pravin Gordhan stops his neoliberal policies which denies black students access to education. The State President has long ago asked Pravin Gordhan to find the money for free education. However instead of taxing white capital and making free education a reality, Gordhan is doing everything to protect white capitalists who have in turn come out to protect him against the law enforcement officers who have now preferred fraud charges against him. Gordhan shall today yet again present a budget review which is aimed at serving white capital at the expense of the people. The budget review today shall be a thank you gesture to the 81 mainly white capitalists who have come out to support Gordhan and to try to intimidate the HAWKS into withdrawing the fraud charges. Pravin Gordhan is captured by white capital. For free education to be a reality, Pravin Must Fall!
