By Andile Mngxitama The court application by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan last Friday night raises many questions. The application is a desperate bid to divert attention from the fact that he is facing fraud charges and must consequently vacate his position as minister of finance. Some of the questions to be asked are the following: 1. Why does the Minister choose such an inappropriate time to throw only allegations and no fact? Why the application after the High Court ruled against the publication of the so called ‘state capture’ report by the former Public Protector Advocate Thuli Mandosela. It seems Gordhan is pursuing a vendetta. The timing and lack of facts proves this.  2. Why is the minister forcing the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and instructing them to dig up dirt since July and saying he will go to court? That means his actions have been pre-meditated and had no intention to act in good faith. 3. The Business Rescue Practitioners (BRP) clearly requested approval from SARB to transfer funds to Bank of Baroda (BOB) under a new account – so where is the so called tax loss and threat? 4. SARB clearly says no complaints or violations have been received – what further purpose is the Minister trying to serve by pressurizing the regulator?  5. Why are personal and private names, including those of minors, being displayed with meaningless transactions? All those are valid transactions. An STR does not mean a wrong transaction. All have reasons. It’s like reading a doctor’s script and guessing the diagnosis.  6. Why has the Minister incurred such costs on legal opinions and wasted public and tax payers money? 7. Why is Minister Gordhan silent on the R26 billion stolen from the Reserve Bank?
