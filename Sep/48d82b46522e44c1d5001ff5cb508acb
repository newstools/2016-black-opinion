By BO Staff Writer The Black Consciousness Movement, Black First Land First (BLF), held a successful Biko lecture at Orlando East in Soweto yesterday. The lecture given by the National Convener of BLF, Andile Mngxitama, was titled “how Biko helps us to think Black First”. Mngxitama said, amongst other things, that the reason why white supremacy continues in South Africa is because even black people have assimilated white thinking. He used the analogy of cats giving rats the education of cats and thereby domesticating them into easy meat for cats. A rat which thinks it is a cat will soon be lunch for cats. Mngxitama said that this is what colonialists did in Africa including South Africa. They used religion, education, prison and death to impose their white thinking on Africans. The BLF leader said that only the black consciousness of Steve Biko can help to liberate the minds of blacks. He quoted Biko when he said that “the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed”. Mngxitama emphasized that whites stole both the land and the minds of black people. Mngxitama spent some time during the lecture explaining the BLF campaign, “Hands Off Zuma – Economic Liberation Now!”. His message was well received. The lecture was attended by well over 300 people including members of the Orlando community. The event was also addressed by Seth Mazibuko of the Orlando Task Team.
